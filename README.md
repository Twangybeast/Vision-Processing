I did stuff.  
This is the stuff.  
I am good at doing stuff.
  
Main Classes:  
PiTest - Takes a picture and processes it, printing the results to the console  
Test - Should no longer be used, replaced by PictureController  
VisionProcessing - Code to put on the raspberry pi during competitions, takes a picture and saves to network tables  
PictureController - Best class here, automatically downloads pictures, choose an initial picture to start from with the console, and browse with arrow keys. It took a long time to do this one. Automatically launches the custom GUI.  
  
  
Note:  
For PictureController, the blue square represents where the robot will aim at. The red lines show where the corners of the target are, according to the computer.
